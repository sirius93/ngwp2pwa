# Angular 2 set-up with webpack2


#### A complete, yet simple, starter for Angular 2 using Webpack.
#### Included service worker module (sw-precase) and related setup for creating PWA(progressive web application) 


### Quick start


```bash
# clone our repo
$ git clone <git-url> my-app

# change directory to your app
$ cd my-app

# install the dependencies with npm
$ npm install

#To Run the development server only
$ npm run server
Note: The PWA will not work on running this command

#To create a build for production
$ npm run build

# start the server
The below command will run a build first the start the server, As there is a dependency.
Ur PWA app should run (Hopefully) :P 
$ npm start
```
